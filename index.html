                As “Filipinas dentro de Cien Años”, this article was originally published serially in the Filipino fortnightly review “La Solidaridad”, of 
                Madrid, running through the issues from September, 1889, to January, 1890.</p>
                <p class="image-font-2">
                    A century hence, the Philippines is a thriving nation that has undergone remarkable transformations in 
                    various aspects. Economically, it has emerged as a major player in the global market, with a diversified 
                    and robust economy. The country has capitalized on its strategic location, natural resources, and a skilled 
                    workforce to attract foreign investments and foster sustainable growth. Industries such as technology, manufacturing, 
                    and tourism have flourished, creating jobs and improving the standard of living for its citizens
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="image-font-3">
                Politically, the Philippines has matured into a stable democracy, with a well-established system of governance and strong 
                institutions. Corruption and inequality, once pressing issues, have been significantly reduced through comprehensive reforms 
                and the enforcement of strict regulations. The government is committed to upholding human rights, promoting social justice, 
                and ensuring equal opportunities for all its citizens. The Philippines actively engages in regional and international affairs, 
                playing a crucial role in shaping global agendas and maintaining diplomatic relations with other nations
            </p>
            <p class="image-font-4">
                Socially, the Philippines has experienced tremendous social progress. Access to education and healthcare has greatly improved, 
                leading to a highly skilled and healthy workforce. Technological advancements have bridged the digital divide, connecting 
                even remote areas to the global network. The country has made significant strides in environmental conservation, implementing 
                sustainable practices to protect its rich biodiversity. Moreover, cultural diversity is celebrated, and there is a strong sense 
                of national identity and unity among the Filipino people

                    is an essay written by Dr. Jose Rizal, the national hero of0 the Philippines, 
                    in 1889. In this essay, Rizal envisioned what the Philippines would be like a 
                    hundred years into the future. Although it was written over a century ago, 
                    I can provide you with a general overview of some key points Rizal discussed in 
                    his essay and offer some speculation on how the Philippines might have progressed 
                    since then.

                        Rizal emphasized the importance of national identity and unity among Filipinos. 
                        He envisioned that the Philippines would have a distinct national identity, 
                        freed from Spanish colonial influences. Today, the Philippines has become an 
                        independent nation, but it has faced various challenges in terms of unifying its 
                        diverse population and addressing regional and cultural differences

                            Rizal highlighted the significance of education in the development of a nation. 
                            He believed that education was crucial in shaping the character of the Filipino 
                            people and that it would bring progress and enlightenment. Over the past century, 
                            the Philippines has made significant strides in improving its education system, 
                            with increased access to schooling and advancements in curriculum and infrastructure

                            Rizal expressed optimism about the economic potential of the Philippines, 
                            foreseeing growth in agriculture, commerce, and industry. While the country has
                             experienced economic development since Rizal's time, there have also been challenges 
                             such as income inequality, poverty, and unemployment. The Philippines has made efforts to 
                             promote economic growth, attract foreign investment, and address socio-economic disparities.

                            Rizal advocated for social reforms and the elimination of social injustices. He hoped for the 
                            eradication of poverty, the improvement of living conditions, and the establishment of a just and 
                            equitable society. Although progress has been made in some areas, social issues such as poverty, 
                            corruption, and inequality still persist in the Philippines today

                    Scarcely had they been attached to the Spanish crown than they had to sustain with their blood and 
                    the efforts of their sons the wars and ambitions of conquest of the Spanish people, and in these struggles, 
                    in that terrible crisis when a people changes its form of government, its laws, usages, customs, religion 
                    and beliefs the Philippines were depopulated, impoverished and retarded—caught in their metamorphosis, without 
                    confidence in their past, without faith in their present and with no fond hope for the years to come. The former 
                    rulers who had merely endeavored to secure the fear and submission of their subjects, habituated by them to servitude, 
                    fell like leaves from a dead tree, and the people, who had no love for them nor knew what liberty was, easily changed 
                    masters, perhaps hoping to gain something by the innovation
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-2">
                    Then began a new era for the Filipinos. They gradually lost their ancient traditions, their recollections—they forgot their 
                    writings, their songs, their poetry, their laws, in order to learn by heart other doctrines, which they did not understand, 
                    other ethics, other tastes, different from those inspired in their race by their climate and their way of thinking. 
                    Then there was a falling-off, they were lowered in their own eyes, they became ashamed of what was distinctively their own, 
                    in order to admire and praise what was foreign and incomprehensible: their spirit was broken and they acquiesced.
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-3">
                    Thus years and centuries rolled on. Religious shows, rites that caught the eye, songs, lights, images arrayed with gold, worship 
                    in a strange language, legends, miracles and sermons, hypnotized the already naturally superstitious spirit of the country, 
                    but did not succeed in destroying it altogether, in spite of the whole system afterwards developed and operated with unyielding tenacity
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-4">
                    When the ethical abasement of the inhabitants had reached this stage, when they had become disheartened and disgusted with themselves, an 
                    effort was made to add the final stroke for reducing so many dormant wills and intellects to nothingness, in order to make of the individual 
                    a sort of toiler, a brute, a beast of burden, and to develop a race without mind or heart. Then the end sought was revealed, it was taken for 
                    granted, the race was insulted, an effort was made to deny it every virtue, every human characteristic, and there were even writers and priests 
                    who pushed the movement still further by trying to deny to the natives of the country not only capacity for virtue but also even the tendency to 
                    vice.
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-5">
                    So great endurance reached its climax with the insults, and the lethargic spirit woke to life. His sensitiveness, the chief trait of the native, 
                    was touched, and while he had had the forbearance to suffer and die under a foreign flag, he had it not when they whom he served repaid his sacrifices 
                    with insults and jests. Then he began to study himself and to realize his misfortune. Those who had not expected this result, like all despotic masters, 
                    regarded as a wrong every complaint, every protest, and punished it with death, endeavoring thus to stifle every cry of sorrow with blood, and they made 
                    mistake after mistake
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-6">
                    Undoubtedly during all this time there were not lacking generous and noble spirits among the dominant race that tried to struggle for the rights of humanity 
                    and justice, or sordid and cowardly ones among the dominated that aided the debasement of their own country. But both were exceptions and we are speaking 
                    in general terms

                <p class="summary-font-1">
                    For the liberal Spaniards the ethical condition of the people remains the same, that is, the native Filipinos have not advanced; for the friars and their 
                    followers the people have been redeemed from savagery, that is, they have progressed; for many Filipinos ethics, spirit and customs have decayed, as decay all 
                    the good qualities of a people that falls into slavery that is, they have retrograded
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-2">
                    Let us pass over the loyalty the Filipinos may feel for Spain; let us suppose for a moment, along with Spanish writers, that there exist only motives for hatred
                    and jealousy between the two races; let us admit the assertions flaunted by many that three centuries of domination have not awakened in the sensitive heart of
                    the native a single spark of affection or gratitude; and we may see whether or not the Spanish cause has gained ground in the Islands
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-3">
                    Formerly the Spanish authority was upheld among the natives by a handful of soldiers, three to five hundred at most, many of whom were engaged in trade and were 
                    scattered about not only in the Islands but also among the neighboring nations, occupied in long wars against the Mohammedans in the south, against the British 
                    and Dutch, and ceaselessly harassed by Japanese, Chinese, or some tribe in the interior. Then communication with Mexico and Spain was slow, rare and difficult 
                    frequent and violent the disturbances among the ruling powers in the Islands, the treasury nearly always empty, and the life of the colonists dependent upon one 
                    frail ship that handled the Chinese trade. Then the seas in those regions were infested with pirates, all enemies of the Spanish name, which was defended by an 
                    improvised fleet, generally manned by rude adventurers, when not by foreigners and enemies, as happened in the expedition of Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, which was 
                    checked and frustrated by the mutiny of the Chinese rowers, who killed him and thwarted all his plans and schemes. Yet in spite of so many adverse circumstances 
                    the Spanish authority has been upheld for more than three centuries and, though it has been curtailed, still continues to rule the destinies of the Philippine group
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-4">
                    On the other hand, the present situation seems to be gilded and rosy—as we might say, a beautiful morning compared to the vexed and stormy night of the past. 
                    The material forces at the disposal of the Spanish sovereign have now been trebled; the fleet relatively improved; there is more organization in both civil and 
                    military affairs communication with the sovereign country is swifter and surer she has no enemies abroad; her possession is assured; and the country dominated 
                    seems to have less spirit, less aspiration for independence, a word that is to it almost incomprehensible. Everything then at first glance presages another 
                    three centuries, at least, of peaceful domination and tranquil suzerainty
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-5">
                    So the Philippine peoples have remained faithful during three centuries, giving up their liberty and their independence, sometimes dazzled by the hope of the 
                    Paradise promised, sometimes cajoled by the friendship offered them by a noble and generous people like the Spanish, sometimes also compelled by superiority of 
                    arms of which they were ignorant and which timid spirits invested with a mysterious character, or sometimes because the invading foreigner took advantage of 
                    intestine feuds to step in as the peacemaker in discord and thus later to dominate both parties and subject them to his authority
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-6">
                    Spanish domination once established, it was firmly maintained, thanks to the attachment of the people, to their mutual dissensions, and to the fact that the sensitive 
                    self-love of the native had not yet been wounded. Then the people saw their own countrymen in the higher ranks of the army, their general officers fighting beside the 
                    heroes of Spain and sharing their laurels, begrudged neither character, reputation nor consideration; then fidelity and attachment to Spain, love of the fatherland, 
                    made of the native, encomendero1 and even general, as during the English invasion; then there had not yet been invented the insulting and ridiculous epithets with 
                    which recently the most laborious and painful achievements of the native leaders have been stigmatized; not then had it become the fashion to insult and slander in 
                    stereotyped phrase, in newspapers and books published with governmental and superior ecclesiastical approval, the people that paid, fought and poured out its blood for 
                    the Spanish name, nor was it considered either noble or witty to offend a whole race, which was forbidden to reply or defend itself; and if there were religious 
                    hypochondriacs who in the leisure of their cloisters dared to write against it, as did the Augustinian Gaspar de San Agustin and the Jesuit Velarde, their 
                    loathsome abortions never saw the light, and still less were they themselves rewarded with miters and raised to high offices. True it is that neither were the natives 
                    of that time such as we are now: three centuries of brutalization and obscurantism have necessarily had some influence upon us, the most beautiful work of divinity in the 
                    hands of certain artisans may finally be converted into a caricature.

                    all that have been ordered up to the present time, they have produced scanty results, for the government as well as for the country. Even those that promised only a happy 
                    issue have at times caused injury, for the simple reason that they have been based upon unstable grounds
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-2">
                    We said, and once more we repeat, and will ever assert, that reforms which have a palliative character are not only ineffectual but even prejudicial, when the government is 
                    confronted with evils that must be cured radically. And were we not convinced of the honesty and rectitude of some governors, we would be tempted to say that all the partial 
                    reforms are only plasters and salves of a physician who, not knowing how to cure the cancer, and not daring to root it out, tries in this way to alleviate the patient’s sufferings 
                    or to temporize with the cowardice of the timid and ignorant. All the reforms of our liberal ministers were, have been, are, and will be good—when carried out

                    When we think of them, we are reminded of the dieting of Sancho Panza in his Barataria Island. He took his seat at a sumptuous and well-appointed table “covered with fruit and many 
                    varieties of food differently prepared,” but between the wretch’s mouth and each dish the physician Pedro Rezio interposed his wand, saying, “Take it away!” The dish removed, 
                    Sancho was as hungry as ever. True it is that the despotic Pedro Rezio gave reasons, which seem to have been written by Cervantes especially for the colonial administrations
                    “You must not eat, Mr. Governor, except according to the usage and custom of other islands where there are governors.” Something was found to be wrong with each dish: one was too hot, 
                    another too moist, and so on, just like our Pedro Rezios on both sides of the sea. Great good did his cook’s skill do Sancho! In the case of our country, the reforms take the place of the dishes, 
                    the Philippines are Sancho, while the part of the quack physician is played by many persons, interested in not having the dishes touched, perhaps that they may themselves get the benefit of them. 
                    The result is that the long-suffering Sancho, or the Philippines, misses his liberty, rejects all government and ends up by rebelling against his quack physician.

                    A government that rules a country from a great distance is the one that has the most need for a free press, more so even than the government of the home country, if it wishes to rule rightly and fitly. 
                    The government that governs in a country may even dispense with the press (if it can), because it is on the ground, because it has eyes and ears, and because it directly observes what it rules and administers. 
                    But the government that governs from afar absolutely requires that the truth and the facts reach its knowledge by every possible channel, so that it may weigh and estimate them better, and this need increases 
                    when a country like the Philippines is concerned, where the inhabitants speak and complain in a language unknown to the authorities. To govern in any other way may also be called governing, but it is to govern badly. 
                    It amounts to pronouncing judgment after hearing only one of the parties; it is steering a ship without reckoning its conditions, the state of the sea, the reefs and shoals, the direction of the winds and currents. 
                    It is managing a house by endeavoring merely to give it polish and a fine appearance without watching the money-chest, without looking after the servants and the members of the family.

                    If the great Napoleon had not tyrannized over the press, perhaps it would have warned him of the peril into which he was hurled and have made him understand that the people were weary and the earth wanted peace. 
                    Perhaps his genius, instead of being dissipated in foreign aggrandizement, would have become intensive in laboring to strengthen his position and thus have assured it. Spain herself records in her history more revolutions 
                    when the press was gagged. What colonies have become independent while they have had a free press and enjoyed liberty? Is it preferable to govern blindly or to govern with ample knowledge?
                </p>
                <p class="summary-font-6">
                    Some one will answer that in colonies with a free press, the prestige of the rulers, that prop of false governments, will be greatly imperiled. We answer that the prestige of the nation is preferable to that of a few individuals. 
                    A nation acquires respect, not by abetting and concealing abuses, but by rebuking and punishing them. Moreover, to this prestige is applicable what Napoleon said about great men and their valets. We, who endure and know all 
                    the false pretensions and petty persecutions of those sham gods, do not need a free press in order to recognize them; they have long ago lost their prestige. The free press is needed by the government, the government which still 
                    dreams of the prestige which it builds upon mined ground.

                        The Philippines, like the rest of the world, is likely to experience 
                        significant technological advancements over the next century. This may include

                        likely face the need for extensive adaptation and mitigation measures to address these challenges. 
                        This could involve implementing sustainable practices, investing in renewable energy, and developing resilient infrastructure
